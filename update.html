<h2>#SaveSattal Update</h2>
<p><br />Dear all,</p>
<p>In our efforts to save Sattal this is where we stand currently.<br /><br />Actions we have taken:</p>
<p><br />1. <strong>Filed RTI&rsquo;s</strong> to obtain information from the concerned departments regarding the planned activity.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Started a petition</strong> on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cmo-uttarakhand-declare-the-sattal-forests-a-conservation-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change.org</a> to gather signatures to support our cause.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Setup a website</strong> for #savesattal, all information regarding the campaign will be updated here: <a href="http://savesattal.thereisnoearthb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">savesattal.thereisnoearthb.com</a></p>
<p>4. We have a <strong>signed appeal from over 500 locals</strong>, whose families would be affected by such development, asking for a conservation reserve.</p>
<p>5. We have <strong>sent a Letter to the DFO</strong> (Divisional Forest Officer), requesting the status of a conservation reserve. Below is a PDF copy of the letter, with annex. This document is a comprehensive document which includes letters of support from ecologists, information regarding the flora and fauna of Sattal, RTI&rsquo;s sent so far and our appeal.</p>
<p><br />Things we are working on currently:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Preparing a proposal</strong>, requesting for the status of a &lsquo;conservation reserve&rsquo; to be presented to the PCCF (Principal Chief Conservator). Awaiting the responses on the RTI&rsquo;s to be able to do this.</p>
<p>2. We are in the process of <strong>compiling a PIL</strong>, which we intend on filing as soon as possible.<br /><br />We are ever so grateful for the support that has been received from innumerable quarters and deeply humbled by the concern shown by so many well wishers and supporters of Sattal.</p>
<p><br />We intend to work with the government authorities to take this forward to its correct conclusion, a conclusion where the forests and people of Sattal area can coexist in harmony.</p>
